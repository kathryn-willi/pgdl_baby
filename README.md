# NGWOS Stream Gage Network Analysis
This repository contains R Markdown/Quarto scripts for analyzing stream gage networks within USGS Next Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS) basins. The workflows retrieve and process hydrologic data from USGS NWIS, link gages to NHDPlus geospatial features, compute network connectivity and distances between gages, and use random forest models to identify landscape characteristics that predict flow similarity across networked stations. The three scripts provide varying levels of analysis depth: ngwos_baby.Rmd includes comprehensive analysis with temperature data and multiple NGWOS basins (Illinois, Upper Colorado, Delaware River Basin), drb_gages.qmd focuses specifically on the Delaware River Basin with detailed StreamCat integration, and ngwos_baby_lite.Rmd offers a streamlined version for rapid data acquisition and basic processing. All scripts integrate EPA StreamCat watershed attributes to characterize catchment properties including land cover, climate, soil characteristics, and infrastructure features.
